Drop a reindeer (=obstacle) in the WinterSIM in the way of the digital miniATV 
and connect the two miniATVs such that both miniATVs stop before crashing into the reindeer.
No real reindeer were hurt during this test.

This has to be installed for this test on the Laptop (it's already installed in the
miniATV for the emergency_stop.launch):
