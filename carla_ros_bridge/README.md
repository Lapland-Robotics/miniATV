### carla_ros_bridge
All carla_ros_bridge files that have been changed for "miniATV goes WinterSIM",
replace the original ones in the opt/carla_ros_bridge/melodic folder.

### Important! 
Use the debian instalation of the carla_ros_bridge instead of the GitHub installation.
The GitHub installation doesn't connect to the WinterSIM automatically and is a bit different than the debian version.
Follow the installation instructions here:
