#### Start Everything

Copy those files into the home directory of your laptop and run wintersim_miniatv_start.sh. 
The other two files are run by this file and start everything in the laptop and everything in the miniATV, 
including the multimaster_fkie nodes.

#### Note!
Those files need a file "ip_addresses.sh" with the credentials for the robot!
