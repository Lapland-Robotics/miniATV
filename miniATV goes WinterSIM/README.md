## miniATV goes WinterSIM

In this subfolder are all files that allow the miniATV to work smoothly with the WinterSIM.


### Install:

#### Install in Laptop:
* [carla_ros_bridge](https://carla.readthedocs.io/projects/ros-bridge/en/latest/ros_installation_ros1/) --> use the debian installation, the GitHub installation is different and doesn't automatically connect to WinterSIM!

#### Install in miniATV:
* [timed_roslaunch](http://wiki.ros.org/timed_roslaunch)
* [ouster_ros](https://github.com/ouster-lidar/ouster-ros)
* [rosserial](http://wiki.ros.org/rosserial) --> for communication with ESP32 motor controller and the GNSS sensor
